			<p>No but seriously, I'm thrilled to be starting a Web Development immersive at Galvanize!  I think it will be a comprehensive curriculum covering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with much, much more.  I've been wanting to learn programming and how to make web applications for quite some time now, and I'm glad I left my job to make it happen.  My educational background is in Regional Planning and Water Resources Management.  Ideally, I'd like to make web applications related to urban and environmental planning using publically available data that will have a real impact on people's lives - for the better.  I don't have many illusions, and I know coding bootcamp will be hard.  I will undoubtedly feel like that poor poor turtle in the above GIF.  Oh well!</p>

			<p>If I do survive in tact, I would like to work at a company that does socially conscious web development work related to social and environmental problems.  This could include working at an awesome non-profit or a consulting firm that has awesome clients.</p>
